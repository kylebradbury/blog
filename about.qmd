I lead applied research projects at the intersection of machine learning techniques and energy problems. My research includes developing techniques for automatically mapping global energy infrastructure and access from satellite imagery; transforming smart electric utility meter data into energy efficiency insights; and exploring the reliability and cost trade-offs of energy storage systems for integrating wind and solar power into the grid.
